I'm no superhero, so my goal was to find the best quality, best tasting food with minimal processing.  Let's face it, there are plenty of organic options out there.

We can eat the fruit varieties without even putting on a bib.  The Chick Chick is the man's favorite (bib required).  The negative is that they're about twice the price of the Gerber fruits and meats.  So if you're on a budget, this may be a bit of a stretch.

I even spiced it up a little bit hoping that she likes it but nope:(I don't blame her.I don't like it either.<br /><br />Update: Few months later I reintroduced my daughter this product and she seems to like it now.

Chick Chick is great, Beef Stew is wonderful, but Gobble Gobble is weird.  My daughter didn't mind the taste, but I could not get over the texture.  It looked like a giant blob of wet dog food.  It was more putty-like than any other flavor.  I actually had to cut bites off of it.  I am grossed out just thinking about it.  Good thing there are other flavors.\n",

It is so thick that my daughter grabs it out of her mouth after putting a bite in, which usually leads to a big mess. I now have to modify the texture by adding water to it, which does not make it a convenient food item when on the go. Since the pouches don't reseal this is even harder when traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the flavor seems good, just too thick. I still love the pouch design for the most part, since I can sometimes break the glass jars of other brands.

      "Original: I enjoy regular coffee for only about the first five minutes after it's brewed - then it no longer tastes good to me.  And if regular coffee is brewed strong, it tastes bitter.  But with Cool Brew, it's possible to make your coffee just as strong as you like because no matter how much you mix into your cup it will NEVER taste bitter!  Here in the south, I use Cool Brew to make really strong iced coffee every morning.  I mix it into either milk or soy milk and it is absolutely wonderful.  GREAT stuff!\n",

      "Original: New to Thai cuisine, I asked to try a milder curry, my tastes running to a maximum of medium heat. Yellow curry was recommended, and the coconut milk based Thai version was a treat with both seafood and chicken-something I've had occasion to order again and again.<br /><br />So when trying to re-create the taste sensations above, I was less than thrilled at the idea of grinding individual spices, purchasing a number of pricey ingredients with limited shelf life and narrow applications.<br /><br />I did some research and found that many Thai housewives rely on the time and labor savings of using high quality curry pastes as the basis for soups, curries and more. Mae Ploy was one of the brands repeatly mentioned as high quality and fresh tasting.<br /><br />This brand comes in a handful of flavors and heat levels, with the Yellow Curry Paste being the first I was eager to try. It has a shelf life of 2 years, and the large plastic pouch also keeps very well nestled in its own colorful tub in the refrigerator.<br /><br />The flavors of lemon grass, shallot, gingery galanga, kaffir lime peel, warm spices and red chili are very well balanced. This is the only Mae Ploy Curry paste without shrimp paste, making it vegan-suitable as well as delicious with shellfish, fish or fowl.<br /><br />I like to snip off one corner of the clear packet, then squeeze out just the amount I need-anywhere from 1/2 teaspoon to 2 Tablespoons, depending on the recipe. This helps to maintain freshness and flavor and avoid waste.<br /><br />For Thai curry, I will combine the Yellow Curry Paste with a small amount of chicken broth, then add 3/4 Cup more broth per person, plus a can of coconut milk to mellow and round the flavor. A cup or two of chunked seafood or chicken, plus cubed potatoes and onion-simmered together for about 30 minutes- makes a very satisfying dish to serve with either traditional sticky rice or more the more occidental long grain variety.<br /><br />Mae Ploy's Thai Yellow Curry is also delicious with just a bit added to your favorite dip, salad dressing, or try a teaspoonful combined with 1 cup of sour cream or plain yogurt 'painted' over your favorite fish fillets and baked just until cooked through, (about 15-20 minutes at 325).<br /><br />The fine quality of this product has encouraged me to order another flavorful curry paste-also excellent-and I would highly recommend this product for those wishing to re-create favorite restaurant fare at a reasonal price, without tedious preparation.\n",

The flavor was more multidimensional than some other curry pastes we have tried. The heat level was just about right for us (we like some heat but not enough to overpower other flavors - the tongue should tingle a bit but not go numb). We still start with some chopped onions and sometimes add more ginger paste but the yellow curry is pretty good right out of the tub. The recipe on the tub suggests 50 grams of paste. We checked with a scale and 1 tablespoon is roughly 25 g (so 2 tablespoons of paste). We like it with a bit less - one and a half tablespoons for the given recipe otherwise it was too hot.

      "Original: Being from Europe, I have used this sauce for years and years. I have not found anything that comes even close to its delicious taste. In Europe you can buy several brands that are alike but I like the Hela brand the best and I always have a bottle in my fridge. I prefer the smaller size bottle (400ml) because it fits better in my fridge door.<br /><br />It says ketchup on the bottle but it nothing like ketchup or the spicy ketchups you can find at the regular shops. You just have to try it for yourself to decide whether you like it or not.<br /><br />The sauce goes well on fried or grilled potatoes but it is also very nice on your bratz or other grilled meats & poultry. Mix it up with some mayonaise and you will get mayonaise with a kick.<br /><br />The only negative I can think of would be the price. The price + shipping would be 7 times more than a bottle bought back home.\n",

      "Original: First of all, yes, it is expensive.  Though currently at $59.99 for a 54 ct, the price is not part of my review.  I'm sure it'll come down eventually.<br /><br />I've been drinking Pike Place for 10+ years now.  As soon as I got my Keurig, I started looking for a suitable replacement blend.  Although there are plenty of fine K-cups to be found, none quite fit the bill.  I ended up just grinding my own Pike Place and brewing it with a Solofill, which was not ideal for two reasons; 1.  The Solofill does not have enough capacity to get the full flavor.  2.  I'm lazy and this defeats the purpose of a Keurig brewer in the first place.<br /><br />There is a reason that Pike Place put Starbucks on the map nearly 40 years ago.  It is THE perfect medium blend.  There is plenty of flavor for dark coffee drinkers to enjoy, and is not too rich or 'burnt' for light coffee drinkers.  It's bright, but not too bright.<br /><br />Does the K-cup version do it justice?  Yes.  Everything I mentioned above is in this little cup.  I just got home with these an hour ago, and 3 cups later, I can honestly say my prayers have been answered.<br /><br />You know what?  Even at $59.99, this review would be 5 stars.

I was so elated when I found out that Starbucks was now going to be in Keurig form, let alone this flavor.  I normally can not stand coffee with cream and sugar.  I enjoy my coffees, black, no cream or sugar, and STRONG.  This one is the lone exception.  Starbucks claims this is a medium roast.  Take it with a grain of salt.  It has a fantastic aroma but a bitter taste, with also a bit of an aftertaste.  The first time I had this at a Starbucks, I wanted to throw this out.  To be honest, it was nasty, but with the price of a Starbucks coffee, at their coffee shop, I refused to give in.  I added (2) packets of sugar, along with some half & half, and \"Oh my God\", I was in heaven.  I should say, this is for an 8oz cup.  Not only is this so good, it's actually my favorite coffee.<br /><br />Now with the K-Cup version... to make the equivalent, I select an 8oz brew, use half & half to where it's a medium brown, and (2) packets of Splenda.  Splenda, in coffee tastes as good as sugar.  I'm diabetic.  This tastes as good as if it was from their coffee shop.<br />Since this can get expensive if your going to have more than (2) cups a day, I've decided to purchase this in 1lb bags and use the \"ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup for Keurig K-Cup Brewers\", to make this more cost effective.<br /><br />The bottom line is I think if you, like me, don't like this coffee, by itself, try it with cream and sugar.  You'll be surprised at the difference in taste.<br /><br />By the way... why this says I'm in New Caledonia, I have no idea nor can I get it to change.  I'm from NJ.\n",

When we recently were visiting in Phoenix, I picked up some groceries, including coffee. I saw this brand and had not had it before, so decided to try it and I have fallen for it, completely. It is so smooth and delicious. If my local grocer won't carry it, I will be buying it here. I even brought back to bags in my luggage so I won't have to be without it!

      "Original: Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon, 2.6oz pouches are a very convenient method of eating on the run or preparing a quick meal when time is short. I recently began using Salmon in the pouch and really like how convenient it is to use and it taste great. The pouch is very easy to open just by tearing the top of the pouch which has a pre-made notch to initiate an easy opening. Once the pouch is open it is not resealable. The Salmon can be eaten directly out of the pouch or you can empty the contents to make a salad or other meal. I now keep some of these Salmon pouches at work and I carry a few in my every day carry (EDC) bag in case I get stuck somewhere and need a quick, easy, and healthy snack to keep me going. I also carry some when hiking, backpacking, or camping.<br /><br />The pouch is relatively strong and would not easily be punctured by an object. As a precaution I do wrap the pouch in a one gallon freezer bag when carrying the Salmon in my EDC bag just as an added measure of caution. Each pouch is considered one portion and contains 70 calories with 20 calories from fat. Each serving contains 13 grams of protein. The pouch has a label stating that the product is skinless and boneless. This Salmon is a good source of protein and Omega-3 fatty acids. The Salmon is labeled as a product of Thailand and the expiration date is over 2 years from that date that I purchased the Salmon so it will last awhile and there is no need to be concerned about the expiration date. I have seen this product on sale at a local grocery store for under a dollar which is a great deal.<br /><br />Overall, I am very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend Chicken of the Sea Premium Wild-Caught Pink Salmon Pouch to others.\n",

All I can say is that if you don't have home roasted peppers on hand these grilled piquillo peppers will definitely fit the bill.  These are the tastiest purchased grilled/roasted peppers that we have ever tasted and I think we are roasted pepper connoisseurs.  This company also does sell a roasted piquillo pepper which for our taste is not quite as tasty as the grilled.  Don't get me wrong, their roasted are also good, but the grilled are over the top.  I do \"roast\" my own and the way I do them we as well as anyone who has ever tasted them go crazy for them.  But again, if you need or would rather purchase cooked peppers the DeLallo Grilled Piquillo Pepper will not disappoint you.  I usually purchase them at the store, however, when I checked the price of them online there was quite a savings at Amazon for a case of 12.  The case arrived in good condition and the jars had an appropriate expiration date on them.  No matter where you get them they are a little pricey, but someone grew and cared for these peppers, grilled, jared, labeled and shipped them.  Allot went into these little jars.  Whenever you see red peppers know that whoever grew them took care of them much longer to get them to the red stage rather than picking green.  I make my own salad dressings and I do add the liquid from the jar to my dressing.  The liquid is  flavored with the natural oil from the peppers and is delicious.  Try them!  You'll like them!\n",

I was unable to find anywhere that sold this tea until recently, when I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. This is a very sweet tea - I always add sugar to tea and this one is sweet enough without any extra sugar. However, the sweetness is not overpowering as it also has a strong spice flavor. It smells amazing while brewing and tastes just as good. It makes excellent hot or iced tea, with or without milk/cream. If you are looking for something a little bit different to spice up your tea cabinet, this is the perfect choice for you!\n",

      "Original: My review covers the Stevia In The Raw product in packet form. I have not tried the bulk product.<br /><br />This is a great alternative sweetener. It leaves no after taste that I can detect. I use it in tea, on cereal and in three different kinds of oatmeal. Everything that I have used it in or on has tasted the same as it did when sugar was used.<br /><br />I cam accross a couple of articles on Stevia while browsing on the Internet. After reading those two articles I did a little more research and decided to try Stevia. I found this product at our local Kroger store where it happened to be on sale. Kroger carries two ro three other Stevia based products however after comparing the list of ingredients for each I decided to buy the Stevia In The Raw. The list of ingredients for the packet form of this product is dextrose and Stevia Extract (Rebiana).<br /><br />OK, I tired it and it tastes great in everyhting I have used it with but I was curious. The Stevia extract is supposed to be 200 to 400 times more intensely sweet than sugar. If that is the case why was dextrose used and why was it the more prevalent ingredient? I called the company on their 800 and asked this same question. The answer is (according to them) that dextrose is a carbohydrate derived from crushed corn. It is a filler in their product. The Rebiana is so intensely sweet that it was impractical to package it in its pure form in individual packets. The volume would be so small that consumers would wonder if anything was really there. To me this sounds plausible. I am not a dietician, a doctor nor do I work for the company. I simply use their product and like it.<br /><br />I hope this info is helpful. Everyone have a gret day out there.\n",

      "Original: First of all, I have no ties with Truvia. In fact, I decided to replace my Truvia recently with Stevia in the Raw which is why I'm now typing this. In my grocery store the Stevia in the Raw was cheaper. I'd always felt Truvia expensive, so I was all over that.<br /><br />While I personally do not believe the phrase \"You get what you pay for\" since sometimes a consumer is only paying for more marketing in a more expensive product...in this case, it's true.<br /><br />I do like sugar in the raw and I do buy it. It's way better than regular sugar being bleached and processed through bone char (for reals).<br /><br />But, first of all, this isn't \"in the raw\". That would mean it's pure Stevia. It also contains Dextrose. Dextrose is a very cheap additive that's sweet that's made from corn. It's high carb. Great if you just finished a tough workout and need carbs. Not great if you call yourself Stevia in the RAW<br /><br />Having formerly worked in food chemical sales, I know that Dextrose is Glucose. This is not an artificial additive, however diabetes is caused by high levels of glucose in the blood. I therefore find it quite scary that this is labeled \"raw\" when diabetics may use it or someone wishing to avoid sugar would use it.  Now granted, Truvia has a fruit sweetener in it as well, because stevia is actually SO sweet that you'd have hardly anything in a pack otherwise because it takes very little stevia to sweeten something, but it's not calling itself \"raw\" either.<br /><br />But let's bypass that and take our sugar/stevia packs and move on. Is the rest the same?<br /><br />Huh-uh.<br /><br />You get 50 packs of Stevia in the Raw in a box.<br />You get 40 packs of Truvia in a box.<br /><br />Superb huh?<br /><br />Likely, because Stevia in the Raw was a tiny bit less expensive, you will do as I did and think \"Woo Hoo! I get more for less!\" Aw, those marketing dogs saw me coming a mile away.<br /><br />Not so fast.<br /><br />I kept making my coffee and hating the taste of it. Bitter.  I began adding 2 packs of Stevia in the Raw. Still not sweet. I had just bought a new coffee and I was thinking it must be stronger of something. Then I found a pack of Truvia I had in the drawer and realized how much MORE was in the pack simply by picking up the pack. I added that one pack to my coffee and it tasted, finally, sweet again.<br /><br />So that got me thinking...<br /><br />I go to the Stevia in the Raw box and look at the net weight of those 50 packets.<br />It is 1.75 ounces.<br />I then, when shopping again, pick up a box of Truvia (and buy it of course because I'm tired of coffee tasting unsweetened.) and for 40 packets it's 4.9 ounces!!!!<br /><br />WOA! I've just been had. I have to use about 3-4 of those Stevia in the Raw packets to equal the taste of one Truvia packet because there is next to nothing inside the packet..just as I suspected. They gave me more packets with less inside each one. So I have to waste paper, and time opening packet after packet just for one cup o' joe.<br /><br />And quite frankly, I don't like deceptive marketing and it's going on all over every 1.75 ounce box of Stevia in the Raw.<br /><br />But, wait...one more thing...<br /><br />Because Stevia in the Raw has sugar in it in glucose form, is it really 0 calories for the same amount? or just a low amount in one packet but by the time you use 4, how many calories may have snuck in....because 0.5 calories can add up too.  Not that I care about 4 calories or 2 calories, but in comparing the two products, and how little is in a packet of Stevia in the Raw...<br /><br />It wouldn't surprise me.<br /><br />Truvia, by the way, has Erythritol in it. This is one of the best all-natural zero calorie sweeteners you can buy. The Brand Z Sweet is erythritol. It's great for diabetics and dieters because it's the one that will NOT spike your blood sugar but is still all-natural. Stevia is so lightweight it needs a counterpart.

I didn't have high expectations as I fully expected them all to leave me with the funky taste. I did not do truvia, because it has another added sweetener - it is not pure stevia.

So far no matter what I've done with this stevia I've had NO aftertaste what-so-ever!!!<br /><br />If you've tried to like stevia and just can't get past the after taste then give stevia in the raw a go - I think you'll be very surprised and pleased as I've been.

I compared it to other sweetners such as truvia and purvia, I like this product because I won't support coca cola(maker of truvia) or pepsi (maker of purvia) if i buy this.  Also, there is only two ingredients : dextrose and stevia extract.  Each pack is 1 gram, so I assume there is maybe 0.9 gram of which is dextrose, which IS a sugar, but the FDA allows the labeling to be such that if a serving is under 4 calories, it can be called 'zero-calories'.<br /><br />To my understanding, dextrose is needed as the bulking agent (probably stevia extract is so potent, no one can use it if its in pure form) Online searching have shown dextrose contains 3.7 cal per gram, so if you have to use many packets for your tea or coffee, it won't be calories-free.  BUT, 3 packets of this (maybe like 10 cal) made my 12 oz of water with lemon juice taste like a real cup of lemonade made with real sugar, and THAT would be like 110 calories. And it taste so much better and healthier than splenda.\n",

      "Original: I agree with other reviewers about Agave in general and also specifically this product.  Know that I have a pretty big sweet tooth, and thanks to Agave I feel I'm slowly taming it.  I do find Agave to be sufficiently satisfying -- with the right amount.  And it makes me feel very good to know I'm not jacking up my blood sugar level with sugar, and that I'm not putting sugar (which I increasingly think of as poison) into my body.

Whenever I visit the store (I live a little ways away), I get orders from at least 5 friends of all the things they want me to get for them. It has quickly become our favorite candy store! I especially appreciate that their candy will never include artificial food coloring or flavors. I can trust that the candy is natural and the owner is so helpful. She will always tell me where the ingredients came from and exactly what is in them. She and her employees have been very easy to work with. My friends who have children with severe nut, gluten and milk allergies LOVE Indie. All their chocolate and candy is made in a big 8 free facility - no cross contamination!!\n",

      "Original: I love this tea.  I first discovered the pleasures of chai after attending a yoga class.  The yoga instructor made tea for us.  I wanted to make some on my own, and I tried many brands and recipes, including making it from scratch.  This is the best tea I found. In my opinion, steeping tea bags makes a weak, bland tea.  You really need to use loose tea and cook it according to the directions.  I use half and half for the milk, and it makes a rich, spicy tea.  Additionally, for the sweetener, I use maple syrup instead of honey or sugar.  It might sound odd, but the maple syrup blends with the chai spices much better.  If you want to make authentic chai (instead of using some kind of processed powdery mix), try this one.\n",

      "Original: You can make this mix yourself, but the Star Anise is often difficult to find.  Usually I use this mix to make Oriental-style pork or chicken dishes, but today I added a little to some fish boiled with lemon juice and black pepper.  It was very good without being actually Oriental in overall impression.\n",

      "Original: Hoping there is no MSG in this, this tastes extremely good when i make it with toasted fish. I used to eat fried chicken and other chicken dishes when i was young and had no idea they tasted so good because of this spice mix. Now i know when i remember about the great aroma and lip smacking flavor this imparts to my fish.  This is also good in soups and gives you a kind of addiction that you will want to put this spice mix into everything you eat.<br />Would like to add this will make anyone eat any kind of meat or vegetable, in my case I prefer costly red salmon in a can but pink salmon is so cheaper and now with Five spice pink salmon toast feels as enjoyable as anything else i have eaten.\n",
